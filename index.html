    <h1 class="h1">About me</h1>
 <p>Hello there my name is Kayla. I was born April 23, 2004 here in Ottawa,Ontario and have lived here my whole life. During my youth my family and I would travel to different places; we once travelled to Disney world for my 5<sup>th</sup> birthday; took a cruise to Alaska in 2010; and another cruise to the Caribbean back in 2012. I enjoy traveling because there are many places to visit and to learn about their <em>cultures.</em> <br>

<br>My favourite colours are blue, black, hot pink, and red. I enjoy working with<em> arts</em> and <em>computers</em>, by using adobe softwares like illustrator. I very much enjoy working with  <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and  <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> code to because it is <em>exciting</em> to learn and I enjoy when we are able to add the style attributes to make the websites your <em>own</em> and <em>unique.</em>
